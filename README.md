## Task Sourcing

The system is a catalogue of tasks submitted by users. Users can either
submit a task or pick a task. Tasks are general chores such washing a car on Kent Valeâ€™s car park on Sunday or delivering a parcel on Tuesday between 17:00 and 19:00. Users who want to pick a task can bid. Some generic common tasks may be available for task requesters to instantiate. The user who submits a task or the system (your choice) chooses the successful bid. Each user has an account. Administrators can create, modify and delete all entries. Please refer to www.taskrabbit.com for examples and data.
